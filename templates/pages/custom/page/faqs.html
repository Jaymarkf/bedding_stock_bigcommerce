                                    On average, our mattress takes 48 hours to one week for it to fully decompress.
                                    However, you may start using your new mattress right away.
                                    In fact, sleeping on your mattress can help with the decompression as well.
                                    Read our <a href="https://beddingstock.com/setup-care-instructions">set-up and care instructions</a> to know more.

                                    It is common for new memory foam mattresses to smell or off-gas upon unboxing because of its materials.
                                    But, you shouldn’t worry. Though the odor from mattress off-gassing is unpleasant, it isn’t harmful for most people.
                                    More so, the smell will often quickly go away.

                                    Yes, all Beddingstock mattresses work well with adjustable beds.

                                    We recommend that you don’t. Because memory foam mattresses are constructed from top to
                                    bottom with memory foam as the top layer and polyurethane foam as the bottom layer,
                                    flipping your mattress upside down will not provide you the best comfort and support.
                                </p>

                                    Not a chance. All the layers of memory foam in our mattresses are gel-infused and expertly crafted with optimal airflow and breathability.
                                    The gel-infused memory foams we use on our mattresses help dissipate heat and regulate body temperature for a more refreshing, more comfortable sleep.

                                    Yes, the zippered mattress cover is removable and washable. It can be machine-washed on a gentle cycle and then air-dried.
                                    But, make sure only to use cold water when washing and avoid heat when drying.

                                    Any among a box spring, steel base, or a platform bed foundation is ideal to go under a memory foam mattress.
                                    The harder the surface, the better the memory foam mattress will perform.
                                    If you don’t have any foundation that has a “give,” you can simply put a piece of plywood on top of it to give the mattress the proper support it needs.

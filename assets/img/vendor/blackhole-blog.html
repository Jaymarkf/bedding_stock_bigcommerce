        <span id="owners">Owners don’t treat their online store
like a brick and mortar store.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="storeparagraph" style="margin: 0!important;">

    It sounds so simple and something they should inherently know, but for a variety of factors it’s not. The core reasons independent owners have made their businesses successful are:

    1. They work hard.
    2. They hire the right people.
    3. They listen to their customers.
    4. The provide a great in store experience.
    5. They differentiate themselves from their competition.

    I was asked by one independent owner recently for a “blue print, template, step by step instructions” on how he can have a successful online business to complement his wildly successful brick and mortar business. While I usually don’t give my secrets away for free, I figured I could make an exception, so I gave them to him.

    1. Work hard.
    2. Hire the right people.
    3. Listen to your customers.
    4. Provide a great online user experience (UX).
    5. Differentiate yourselves from your competition.

    Many independent owners have been thriving for decades, so these things don’t scare them or they would have gone out of business a long time ago. However, once you look closer you see something that does scare many owners and it can be summed up in only one word.

    <img style="font-size: 1rem;" src=" https://alwaysopencommerce.com/wp-content/themes/alwaysopencommerce/assets/images/blog-post/change-banner.png" />

</div>
<div class="change" style="margin-top: 0!important; padding-top: 0!important;">
    <div class="change-text" style="margin: 0 !important;">
        <h1>Change</h1>
        “The only constant in business is change” which means owners should be well equipped to handle all the change that comes with running an online business. However, many I meet fail to apply their same core principals to their online business. It all starts and stops at the top; the owners themselves and 1. on the list.

        Most owners can’t work hard on their online business because they are already working hard on their brick and mortar business. I have yet to meet an owner of any size, in any vertical, anywhere in the world who said, “Sure. I have an extra 50-60 hours a week to wear another hat.”

        Yes, there is a “can’t teach an old dog new tricks” aspect happening as many owners in the independent channel are on the north side of 60, so this whole technology (change) thing is certainly harder for them to grasp. But that’s not the core issue. It’s the time or lack thereof.

        Okay, so owners don’t have time to do a lot of things this isn’t exactly a revelation. That’s why there is 2. on the list as they just hire the right people to get the job done. Problem solved.

        Only this creates a bigger problem as many owners don’t know who to hire, so often they hire the wrong people. With the right people a business can do tremendous things. With the wrong people a business can go out of business.

    <div class="looking-banner-img-m" style="background-image: url('https://alwaysopencommerce.com/wp-content/themes/alwaysopencommerce/assets/images/blog-post/above-middle.png');">
        <h1 id="looking-for">They are looking for
            the wrong people
            to begin with.</h1>
    </div>
    <span style="margin: 0;">Instead of looking externally for an e-commerce manager with business experience they look for an “IT guy” with IT experience. The world certainly needs IT guys and my company would not run without them, but they are there to help build the online store, not the online business. They need to be an integral part of the team, not run the team.</span>

    Instead of looking internally at a top performing store manager, salesman, or marketing lead who can learn the e-commerce manager position they look for an underachiever who isn’t an asset to the business. Why? An e-commerce manager is still not seen by many owners as a real full time position in their company, so taking away a top performer from something that does make money to put them on an unknown is viewed as counterproductive.

    Imagine an independent opening a new flagship brick and mortar store that will be their most visited and visible. The owner first goes to hire a store manager who will help build the team and run the day to day.

    Would they look to hire outside the company for someone with IT experience (IT Guy) or someone with business experience in retail (Business Guy)?

</div>
<div id="m22" style="margin-left: 22px;">
    <div>
        <h2>Business Guy</h2>
        Would the owner look to hire within the company and
        promote a bottom performer who doesn’t even do the bare
        minimum or a top performer who excels and goes above
        and beyond?

    </div>
    <div class="">
        <div class="">
            <h2>Top Performer</h2>
            If an IT guy or bottom performer was running that flagship brick and mortar store then I would question the long-term profitability and viability of that location. In the brick and
            mortar world this would never happen to any store, let alone
            their flagship. In the online world, it happens every day and
            whether owners like it or not their e-commerce store is now
            their flagship location.

<div class="buckparagraph" style="margin-left: 22px; padding-top: 5px !important;">

    The buck stops here as 3-5 on the list won’t even come into play without an engaged owner and the right people leading the way. Only the buck doesn’t stop internally, it gets passed externally and a phrase I have heard on multiple occasions, from multiple independent owners gets thrown around.

    No, not the one in space. The one in a business where money keeps getting dumped into an initiative with no ROI. Are the owners, right? Can their online business become the proverbial black hole they fear the most?
    <div class="yes-text" style="margin: 0 !important;">
        <h1>Yes</h1>
        Only not for reasons most think and this goes back to the early days when an online store was a minimum 6 figure investment. Ten plus years ago it was expensive to get into e-commerce and out of the reach for almost all independents. They have all heard the horror stories of enormous sums going into technology with no results. This should scare anyone.

        Flash forward to today and SaaS e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce have leveled the playing field for independents. Even five years ago if I would have told an owner in the appliance vertical that they could be on the same technology, infrastructure, &amp; receive the same support as GE Appliances for only $299 a month, then I would have been called crazy.

        Over time, technology (tangible or not) gets better, more intuitive, sleeker, faster, &amp; more affordable. No different than the products they sell, but independent owners still predominantly attribute a direct correlation to the black hole and technology. Also, technology supporters like ourselves often get sucked in as well. Technology and those who support it should be independents best friend, not their enemy.

        After I already put pen to paper on this post I ran across a great article from Forbes; “Independent Home Furnishings Retailers Are Losing. Only The Big And Virtual Will Survive.” I would slightly alter this headline to “Many Independent Home Furnishings Retailers Are Losing.” There are some independents who have gotten their act together and fully embrace e-commerce, but I would put them in the minority.

            the Black Hole, What Is?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="indent" style="margin: 0 !important;">

        In Feb 2020 I was at an event in Houston where I was set to present with some colleagues in front of a small buying group of about 10 independents. Right before I was about to speak the head of the group stood up and said, “If you do not do this, you will go out of business.” I did not know he was going to say this and while I would not have been so blunt, certainly echoed this sentiment. Now he was not referring to next month, next year, or even the next 5 years. This was more of a 10-15 year down the line statement.

        Look at that date again. At this point Covid was still just a joke or a punch line to many. I know I was still sending memes on how the Corona Virus was only going to be bad for Corona Beer sales. Then a month later the world changed almost overnight. Stores closed and ecommerce boomed, which gave those words even more immediate merit.

        This of course meant the independent owner who spoke worked even harder to get their online business up and running, right? They would put the right people in place, right? Then everything else would take care of itself, right?

    <div class="indent">
        <p class="paragraphtop">The irony is that at the same time independent owners should be putting their all into building a real online business, their time became even more valuable and even less available. In this case, the independent was migrated to a better e-commerce platform in BigCommerce. Unfortunately, over the last year no other changes have been made, so their online business never materialized.</p>

        <h1>Self Fulfilling Prophecy</h1>
        “A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an originally false belief leads people to act in ways that objectively confirm that belief.”

        The original belief of many independents is an online business will be a black hole and then their actions lead directly towards this result confirming that belief.

        <h1 id="organization">Organizational Change</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="indent">

        Hiring an e-commerce manager, upgrading technology, creating an awesome UX, improving the product data, committing to digital marketing, and utilizing top 3rd party apps all mean nothing and will turn into a black hole very quick without organizational change from within the business.

        Easy for me to sit up on my pedestal and type from a far on all the things others are doing wrong, but everything stated above I can just as easily say about myself. I resisted organizational change for many years for the same core reason; time.

        I am the owner of an e-commerce BPO agency in the Philippines and an owner of an e-commerce bed-in-a-box business that I bought from a former client, so time is not a luxury I have. It took a scare of losing my bed-in-a-box business in Summer 2018 due to Antidumping that finally forced my hand. I had to embrace change or face the potential of losing both businesses.

        Switching from supporting Magento and Shopify to BigCommerce was a big change. Rebranding our entire business and Always Open Commerce website to focus more on what we are was a big change. Upgrading our team tracking and project management app was a big change. Working with a 3rd party digital marketing agency for the first time was a big change. Moving to Thailand to be closer to my office was a big change.

        Did these changes help? Absolutely and they were necessary, but my investments would have turned into a black hole without making organizational changes from within my business. Working hard has never been an issue for me, but no one does anything great alone. For my company, I already had the right people, just not in the right positions.

        So, I shuffled some people around and with the help of my newly assembled team, made other organizational changes and boom we were successful overnight! Well, no. I wanted and expected instant results. Who doesn’t? Only it didn’t happen as fast as I hoped. It took time. About two years to be exact.
        <h1>You Make the Time</h1>
        <p class="p-bottom">I asked someone who I admire and respect how he had the time to get to his esteemed position in the independent channel, raise a family, and get a law degree. His reply was simple; “You make time.”</p>
        If an initiative is important to the business then the owner will make time to get it done and it will be successful. If an initiative is not important then they won’t make time and it will never be successful. Some things are that simple.

        <h1 id="decisive">Be Decisive</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="indent-footer" class="indent">

        My advice to independent owners is to be decisive and then stick to it. If you want a successful online business then you must go all in. No one is going to do it for you. There is no blueprint, template, or step by step instructions on how to build a successful business of any kind. If it was that easy then everyone would do it.

        If you think you are not ready then better to stay on the sidelines until you are. There is no middle ground. Doing only some of the core principles that made you successful, but not all, will create a black hole for your business regardless of your technology and those who support it.

        Believe me, I wish I had all the answers in my back pocket during two separate periods over the last 12 years when I struggled to lead through organizational change. I didn’t know how much it would cost. I didn’t know how long it would take to get an ROI. I didn’t even know what I was doing some of the time.

        But I did know change was necessary &amp; each time I had a few secrets to depend on.

        1. Work hard.
        2. Hire the right people.
        3. Listen to my customers.
        4. Provide a great experience for my clients.
        5. Differentiate ourselves from our competition
